# Padoru-Manager
Management Utility Program for my Padoru-Padoru image collection repo

# What is this?
This is a small Management Program to make it easier to manage 
& update a collection of padoru images, including indexing in json format.

# What is Padoru?
A Meme in the Anime- Community. See [here.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/padoru)

# Why?
* Because its almost Padoru- Time :P
* I was bored
* I couldn't find a (good) collection of padoru images
* Managing a collection of images manually is kind of difficult

# Disclaimer
* This Program is by no means written with best- practices in mind. I teached programming to myself, so many things will be badly and/or oddly in design
* English isn't my main language. Expect spelling and grammar errors in everything I write.
* This Program is only intended for private (= non- commercial) use. Used Librarys may not be OK to use in a commercial context.
* Feel free to use this code to learn programming yourself. Just keep in mind that you're not learning from a pro.
* If you use (part of) this code in something useful, please consider menitoning me (and this repo) in some way.
